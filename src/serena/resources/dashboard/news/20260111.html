    <h3>Extended Symbol Information, Type Hierarchy and Compact Overviews</h3>
    <p class="date">January 11, 2026</p>
    <p>
        Recent commits and a new plugin release provide major new features!
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Extended symbol information:</strong> The `find_symbol` and `find_referencing_symbols` tools (and their JetBrains variants)
            now can return more information about the symbol (specifically, docstrings and signatures).
        </li>
        <li><strong>Type hierarchy tool:</strong> A new tool &ndash; exclusive to <a href="https://oraios.github.io/serena/02-usage/025_jetbrains_plugin.html">JetBrains mode</a> &ndash;
            that can fetch a symbol's hierarchy, i.e. superclasses and subclasses, which is very useful in many situations.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Compact overviews:</strong> The `get_symbols_overview` tools now return a much more compact
            representation, saving many tokens. The JetBrains variant of the tool can now return a file's docstring (LSP
            varian't can't do that yet).
        </li>
    </ul>
